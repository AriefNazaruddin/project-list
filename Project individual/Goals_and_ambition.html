	<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;"> This page will cover my long term goal and short term goal, which I consider it is the reason why I has will to study and keep pushing my body
	and also train my body to achieve it. I also set time when I can achieve each one of it and also I create a quote to keep excited everytime I learn new knowledge in somthing that I interest.

					<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">
						My first and main goals or ambition is become Articial Intelligent(AI) Engineer which is a part of my long term goal. AI engineer is a person that build AI model using machine 
						learning algorithm and deep learning neural network to draw business insight. I interest in this work of field because as the visitor know that I mention in page <a href="" style="color:white;" target="_blank">
						Obession</a> , I was a enthusiast in smartphone. This is because Starting from 2018 Huawei the manufacturer of smartphone based in China launched their chipset Hisilicon Kirin 970 that 
						has a deep learning features, from that smarphone with this chip can read the pattern of users use their phone. For example, one user only use his/she smartphone to open up social media and 
						this AI features recognize the pattern of it user and create algorithm to disable all apps that are not related to social media, with this features it can save our smartphone battery live.
						I have faith that one day this features will become more powerfull to handle daily basic of human does just like Jarvis in the Ironman movie that do all the things that Tony Stark asked him.
						Nowdays technology evolve like speed of light, everydays must have at least one technology that lauched to ease everyone on earth this is because many companies compete with each others to lunch their 
						new technology that make the job opportunities in this sector become more and more demand for people, more over the high quality worker. For me AI is like machine that has it own brain to identify behaviour of 
						it users but this features nowdays is evolve until it can make a video using someone face or rather we call it as a deepfake. That is the bad side of this features because it can copy face of someone powerfull to 
						make a fake video, not just that, I believe that one day if this features is wrongly use by users it can harm a country. I want to pursue my studies in this course in UiTM know as Bachelor of Information System(Hons.)
						Intelligent System Engineering next year. I also make a research about how much can we gain or our salary for this type of field of work. I show it in the below of this paragraph along with the 
						others reasearch materials.

			<tr>
				<td><p style="font-size:18px; text-align:justify;">Next is my short term goal which is to become one of the national athlete as we seen in the Tv everytime has a big tournament like ASEAN Game or ASIAN Games.
				As I mention in <a hre=" "  target="_blank" style="color:white;"> obession page, I have high interest in sport and also poeple I admired so much because of his hardwork to changed his fate after
				involves in sport. Honestly, I don't want to be like him because in Malaysia, everyone has a mindset that if we focus on sport we can't focus on others thing such as our studies including my parents think
				like this but I will managed my schedule on when to training and when to study. The obession page also mention that I used to represent my school in variation sport but to be honest my main sport is in athletics.
				Back then in secondary school I was famous because I was the only Malay guy that can join the long-distance event while others is Indian. I started involves in long-distance since form 1, when I got number 3 in 
				cross-counrty and from that I realize that my special ability is my stamina and how I handled my mental while running. Time by time and every evening I always train myself with jogging around my neighborhood to increase my stamina,
				until I got selected as one of the athlete to represent my school in Cross-Country district tournament in form 2 but unfortunately I failed to make a placement to get a medal because they only count place 1 until 20.
				After that I decided to improve my ability in running but for some reason I have to withdraw the next year which in form 3. While in, form 4 I got chance to represent my school again in Cross-Country but still I failed to bring back 
				a medal to my school.</p> 
				<br><br>

				<p><em>Photos of me before and After training</em></p>
				
				
				<p style="font-size:18px; text-align:justify;">At that time too i also decided to joined athletics tournament between school but I have no luck because that years the tournament got cancel due to semo reason. Knowing that I got no chance in the same year
				I decided to improve until I have to break my body limit to the end and I train myself even more painfull than the last years. Again I got to represent in the same tournament and this time I am fully prepare to bring back medal to my
				school but just a slightly different distance with another participant I got number 21, just one place to put me in the podium. After the tournament I feel a little bit down because I got no chance left since it was my last years to active 
				in sport at school. Then at the same year I got lucky because that year there was a athletics tournament to atone my lost in Cross-Country tournament. I joined the 5000m and end up got no medal too, then in 1500m I qualified to the final 
				because I got no 2 in selection to final, that time I really shine because in the final lap I push myself to run fast as I can while crowded from another school that bring their athlete that are outnumbered my school athletes cheer their 
				athletes but I disapoint them with my comeback and got number 2. The next day I was compete for my next event which is 800m and also qualified to the final but not qualified to 4x100m event. The last day when all the final being held, the first events is final 
				1500m but ended up got no medal, knowing that I does not have any individual event after this I made my coach proud by got bronze medal 800m. The same day I and my team joined 4x400m and end up qualified to final and in the final everyone was watching because 
				that was the highlight and last event for that tournament. The same feel that I felt in 800m event, I put everything in this one run of laps and run as fast as I can until that lap was lead by me and pass my baton to next person and person after person until
				4<sup>th</sup> person with slightly different in time our school made it placement no 2 and it really frustated my coach because that medal was the most demanded medal for all school but miracle happened when my coach want to take the medal but they give gold medal istead 
				of silver medal, they said that the school that got first place is disqualified at 3<sup>rd</sup> laps.</p>

				<p><em>Photos of me holding medal that I got from sport tournament School level and with my friends after winning 4x400m level Gombak district</em></p>
				
				<br><br>
				<p style="font-size:18px; text-align:justify;">After the tournament I decided to quit from running but the same year also being held the ASEAN Game 2017 Kuala Lumpur and I watched the events 100m that catched my eyes
				and the athlete from our country which is Khairul Hafiz Jantan won the event. After watched the event I become more excited and decided to run again until I can represent Malaysia. Until now I train myself in order to achieve it and target to made a move in my 
				degree years. Wish Me luck..</p>
