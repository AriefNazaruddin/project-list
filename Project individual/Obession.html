			<p>First and the most thing I excited to express is about my obession toward technology because we can see how technology evolve from time to time to ease every thing we human 
			do in daily life, to set an example the system of communication we always use even before we free from colomialism, our great granparents used to write a letter to communicate 
			then it evolve to email and now we use Internet to communicate with each others with now our country is seek to bring 5G network technology to replace the 4G. Of course this 
			make me more excited and I am looking forward to it. The thing is in Technology I more interested in PC hardware and Smartphone and in this portfolio I will explain my 
			experience and catch up with this of obession</p>

			<p>The first and the best of all about technology is how PC hardware evolves and not just that, most of the PC company allowed us, users to customize our PC hardware
			such as CPU, Motherboard (Mobo), RAM, casing, graphic card (GPU), power supply (PSU) and storage, also we can add others features to improve our PC performance or to 
			make our PC looked beautiful such as All-In-One water cooling and RGB fan. Nowdays, CPU or we call central processing unit for PC often associated with giant companies
			which are AMD and Intel. This two company always compete to bring good CPU to users. They must consider the clock of CPU, power usage of CPU or we call it TDP and with
			the high power comes with high temperature for CPU that can cause CPU downclock and harm the CPU, for that they also has to consider how to give lowered TDP and
			lowered temperature but with high clock speed.Once upon a time users always choose Intel for the good processor but starting from 2016 AMD comes out with their first 
			generation of CPU Ryzen that beats all the Intel's CPU in term of multicore, temperature, clock speed and most important things is most affordable CPU that time.
			Now Ryzen has evolve much better with 5<sup>th</sup> generation and beat all factor of Intel including single core that make Intel so much special once upon a time, but it not posibble that Intel will
			make comeback later on. AS a PC enthusiast, I also want to build my own PC but for now I need to save my money more because all the hardware that I want is a bit pricy.
			Next of this paragraph is list of hardwares that I want.</p>

			always want to study this kind of skill to ease my family and friends. This skill help a lot of my family and friend, even myself because my laptop was the first to test

			<p style="font-size:20px">Beside PC hardware, I also a smartphone enthusiast even before I gain knowledge about PC hardware, smartphone was the first that I enthusiast beacuse in 2017 I decided to buy a new 
			phone but I was sceptical about which smartphone should I buy and that was the starting I read and update about the news of smartphone until now, even I has bought my new phone in 2017
			but it already been 3 years since then. Honestly, I felt keep updated to PC hardware news much better than smartphone because most of the smartphone company used to offered the smartphone 
			with the high price tag such as Samsung and Apple but everyone know that smartphone can't beat laptop or PC in term of functionality because there are lot limitation using smartphone. I
			always asked myself is it worth if I spend thousand of ringgit for something that has a lot of limitation, even all things I bought I used to consider it just like smartphone. Despite that 
			there are few manufactures that offered the smartphone worth value for money for now because they heard end-users's complained that nowdays smartphone are to expensive to buy, so existed all this 
			manufacturer to overcome the complained that end-users made. Fun fact from this knowledge, smartphone has 3 main classes which is entry level, mid range and flagship. Entry level was the low power
			smartphone and budget since it use chipset that are got to perform only daily basic task. While, mid-range was a class which offer the upgradability than entry level but less performance than 
			flagship, also with mid price tag around RM 600 to RM 2000. The last class is flagship which offered the best performance and features for all thing such as gaming that can make a 
			heavy load on CPU, this smarphone come with price tag RM 2000 and above such as Iphone series from Apple and Galaxy S series from Samsung but certain manufacturer offered this class
			with less than RM 2000 price tag like POCOPHONE F2 pro from subrand of Xiaomi which is Poco

				he joined Juventus in 2017 for 100 milion pound offered to Real Madrid. The transfer of Cristiano Ronaldo made him the person that played in 3 league along with his career. The things is 
				since he joined and debut in Manchester United it become the world famous Club in the world, even fact said that Manchester united is the world biggest and has many fans around the world
				compare to others club. Now this club has the bad reputation since Alex Furguson, club manager that raise this club name until can get 38 trophies for this club has left
				or retired from managing club in 2013. Manchester United nowdays has more defeated than won, it really made me sad since we all know what Manchester United used to be in the past
				but it not stop me from being fans of Manchester United, I am sure one day Manchester United will become the great Club again in the future that it used to be</p>

				<p style="font-size:20px;">Japanese animation or we prefer known as Anime was a animation series or movie that all over the world like to watch it from all genres including me. I started watch anime since 
				I was 7 years old, that time our local Tv airing the anime called Naruto and I was fascinated from that anime because it show the moral value and also can shaping children's personlity.
				The good things about anime is how the main characters managed to solve all of their problems with their own ways, some of them show that the spirit by not giving up on anything or anything 
				that precious for us and that the part of anime that I like. Apart from that, being the anime fans also make I want to know what happen in the next episode of that anime I watched but 
				I has to wait until next episode aired. The solution for this situation is by reading manga(comic from Japan) of that anime because anime was originated by storyline in manga but I doesn't like 
				to read manga istead of I search in youtube that has someone talk about it. Not just that, anime watcher want to know the more about the arc(the term refers to significant story 
				within an anime series that is given focus through more than one episode) but have some of anime's manga that did not complete yet, by that existed the speaker youtube that predict and 
				made a teory what gonna happen by watched and focus on the hint about what gonna happen next.</p>

							<p>One of my favourite anime was the the anime that I recently watch 3 months ago which is One Piece. One Piece was originated from manga series written by Eiichiro Oda
							since 1997 until now and 2 years after their manga released Toei Animnation confirmed that One Piece got anime adaption. This anime is categories by fantasy and adventure fiction
							about 17 years old man dream to become a pirate king somedays, from that he sail out to the sea in order to achieve his dream and recruit a crew to join his pirate crew named Straw Hat Pirate
							since he wear straw hat that he pirate friend gave, everyone called him as Straw Hat Luffy or his real name is Monkey D. Luffy. Until now this anime has not compeleted yet, it still has 
							about 5 years from now to end this anime said Oda after a fans asked when this anime will end. The total episode of this anime is 951 episodes, at first I consider it too much of episode for 
							one anime but I spend 3 month to catch up with this anime, I found out that this anime was a masterpiece and no wonder it has so many episodes because every details in every arc Oda put it 
							really leave a question mark to all fans of One Piece out there. Beside that, the thing I love about this anime is how Oda put the moral value into it such as we must value our friendship or 
							relationship more, we must not think when we have power we must discriminate the weak one in order to feel satisfied because in this anime has some of the human race called 
							themself as god and discriminate the others human lowered than it race even this race has it own slave from others race. Honestly, start watched this anime since primary school but at that time 
							we can't freely watch anime on Internet like now, so I watched on Tv7 on our local TV station until episode 53. When I watched it back from episode one 3 month ago the original soundtrack really 
							make me feel nostalgic.</p>
